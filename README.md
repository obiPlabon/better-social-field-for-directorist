Enhance the Directorist social media field with a faster, smarter, and cleaner user experience â€” no unnecessary AJAX, no duplicates, and simpler UI.

== Description ==

The **Better Social Field for Directorist** improves the default social media field experience in the [Directorist](https://wordpress.org/plugins/directorist/) directory plugin.

By default, Directoristâ€™s social media field uses a dropdown + repeater structure that:
- Sends an unnecessary AJAX request for every new icon added.
- Shows all social networks, even those irrelevant to your directory niche.
- Allows duplicate social entries (e.g., multiple Facebook links).
- Creates a slow and confusing user experience for listing owners.

This plugin fixes all of that!

#### ðŸš€ Key Improvements:
- **No AJAX overhead:** Adds multiple social icons instantly, client-side only.  
- **Cleaner UX:** Direct inline editing â€” no need for repetitive clicks.  
- **Prevent duplicates:** Each social network can only be added once.  
- **Smart filtering:** Define which social networks your directory uses.  
- **Lightweight:** No bloat, no dependencies â€” just improved logic and UI.

Perfect for any directory site that wants faster, more intuitive listing forms.

### Features
- Instant field rendering without AJAX requests.
- Choose which social platforms to display (filter out unused ones).
- Prevent adding the same social platform twice.
- Sleek and minimal UI that fits natively into the Directorist design.
- Compatible with all modern browsers.
- Works seamlessly with the latest Directorist version.
